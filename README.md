# Music Player Web App with ReactJS

This repository contains the source code for a tutorial on building a music player web app using ReactJS. The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for building a responsive music player that allows users to browse and play songs from a collection.

## Features

- Song browsing: The music player allows users to browse through a collection of songs, view their details, and select a song to play.
- Play controls: The music player includes play, pause, next, and previous buttons for controlling the playback of songs.
- Song progress and duration: The music player displays the progress and duration of the currently playing song, allowing users to track the playback.
- Responsive design: The music player is designed to be responsive and can be used on various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: The music player is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) are used for styling the music player, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
- Media playback: The Web Audio API or HTML5 Audio API is used for handling media playback and controlling the audio files.
- Icon library: An icon library, such as Font Awesome or Material Icons, is used for displaying icons for play, pause, next, and previous buttons.
- State management: A state management library, such as Redux or MobX, can be used for managing the state of the music player and handling user interactions.
